# network-telescope-data
Right now this repo hosts a simplified fork of the data from zeroklone/network-telescope-data.
The simplified data has been reordered and only the timestamps, IP addresses and countries have been preserved.

A new repo was created with the full data (reordered). This is due to LFS restrictions on GitHub.
